## An experimental birthday countdown clock

This is a component-based exercise in JS and jQuery skills development, based around the idea of creating a birthday countdown app.

It will eventually take the shape of a ReactJS/Redux app, with integrated API, once all components have been individually built and refined. 

The project is styled using Flexbox and [Flexbox Grid Mixins].

N.B. This is a work in progress, and not designed to be a functioning app yet.

To run:
* clone the repo
* run `npm install` to install node modules in the repo root
* run `npm install flexbox-grid-mixins`
